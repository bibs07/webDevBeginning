#Test 1 (Pankcake Clone):
I tried to clone https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/21014/good-old-fashioned-pancakes/ with the use of HTTP and CSS only.

#TEST 2 (Portfolio Website Clone)
On this try, I cloned the site shown in https://dribbble.com/shots/9936700-Folium-Programmer-Portfolio with the use of HTTP and CSS only. It's responsive too.
